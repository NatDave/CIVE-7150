# CIVE 7150
  ## Data-Driven Decision Support ðŸ’»
+ I took this course in the second semester of my PhD.
+ It presents *supervised* and *unsupervised* methods for dealing with large data sets and their application to support decision making in various areas.
+ Focuses on predictive models and methods for knowledge mining.
+ Discusses applications from the transportation, urban mobility, and infrastructure maintenance domains.
+ Demonstrates the applicability and underlying principles of the various methods through case studies with extensive data sets.

+ ***Topics include***:
  - [x] Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
  - [x] classification: linear regression, logistic regression, K-NN, and other classifiers
  - [x] dimensionality reduction
  - [x] clustering: K-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models, density-based clustering
  - [x] model validation
  - [x] text mining

There are numerous machine learning algorithms, each designed to solve different types of problems and tasks. Here's a list of some common machine learning algorithms categorized by their primary use:

Supervised Learning Algorithms:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
